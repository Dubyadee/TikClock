This is a p5.js coded clock screensaver. It simply tells the current time in milliseconds, seconds, minutes, and hours.
The idea of using "progress" bars came from the popular idea of time being compartmentalized into measurements that can be "finished". A matter of change being punctuated by a reset or revisitning a kind of starting place. While round clocks and numerical displays get this done, I felt like a solid, progress-oriented object would better communicate the silliness of this idea. THe colors chosen are meant to display sand and various depths of water, materials commonly associated with or utilized in telling time. I left the larger measurements as "ticking bars" to homage to an authenticity factor in Rolexes, whether or not the arms "tick". The milliseconds bar moves smoothly to offer brief truth of the fluidity of time beyond measurement.

Prof. Zach Whalen provided the code used to track and display milliseconds, but the rest is mine.
